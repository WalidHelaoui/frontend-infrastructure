# Frontend Infrastructure

## Mission

- Empower frontend web developers with reliable, performant, and developer-friendly tools.
- Move core metrics (developer experience, developer velocity, debuggability, performance, and reliability)
- Enhance developer productivity by improving the tooling setup - linting, unit and end to end tests alongside continuous integration and continuous delivery.
- The frontend infrastructure team strives to provide product teams with the tools and capabilities to efficiently build great user experiences. We shape the architecture of the frontend across the company. We make platform-wide changes and upgrade the entire codebase along the way with codemods.

## Skills

- **Frontend Web Testing**: Infrastructure and testing framework integrations enabling developers to write a comprehensive set of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for the range of projects that live in our TypeScript monorepo
- **Frontend Web Observability**: Client-side web logging libraries, integration with vendor error monitoring solutions, alert generators for standard web metrics as well as their usage in automated canary analysis, and testing solutions to ensure logging quality in collaboration with other infrastructure teams
- **TypeScript Monorepo & Developer Productivity**: Build system and CI jobs for our typescript monorepo and associated optimizations for speed and stability, updates and support for foundational infrastructure libraries (e.g. yarn, TypeScript, Babel), and tools that aim to increase developer productivity from providing bundle size insights to a CLI that insulates developers from underlying command changes and improves command discoverability
- Improving developer productivity and velocity through the development and/or optimization of tools and libraries
- Partnering with product teams to encourage adoption of tools and frameworks
- Familiarity with web development cycles (e.g. package management, module bundling, unit, and integration testing, browser capabilities, etc.);
- Knowledge of modern front-end tech stack (we use Typescript, Javascript, React/Redux, ES6, Webpack, styled components, CSS);
- Interest in infrastructural and foundation technologies in frontend/web related domains;
- Deep understanding of webpack and its surrounding technologies (plugins, compiler hooks);
- Previous experience with developing reusable UI components, and/or implementing WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines);
- Experience with deployment automation tools (e.g. Jenkins, AWS Codepipeline, TravisCI, CircleCI, etc) and/or Shell/Bash script.
- Research and test new languages, libraries and frameworks and evaluate their potential to make sure we never stop innovating.
- Share your experiences and expertise with those around you, and multiply your impact through thoughtful teaching, influencing, and setting examples.
- Architect, design and guide the future direction of core architecture in our frontend framework
- Create the infrastructure so teams can start building new front end applications without needing to know how to build and deploy them
- Own front end best practices and enforce them with static analysis and eslint rules
- Provide teams with visibility into their test coverage and frontend performance
